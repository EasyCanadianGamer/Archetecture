Initialization:

Begin the _init function by saving the current frame pointer and link register.
Call a weak function if available and then restore the previous state before returning.
PLT Setup:

For each function in the Procedure Linkage Table (PLT), set up the stack frame.
Load the address of the function to be called and branch to it, allowing dynamic linking of library functions like exit, __libc_start_main, and others.
Main Execution:

In the _start function, initialize stack pointers and move input arguments to appropriate registers.
Call __libc_start_main to begin the main function of the program.
If __libc_start_main fails, call abort.
Global Destructor Management:

Register and deregister global destructors for cleanup tasks at program termination.
Main Function Logic:

In the main function, save the current execution state and load input arguments.
Check conditions on the arguments and call various functions (f1, f2, f3, f4) for processing.
Each function performs operations such as loading values, manipulating data, and returning results.

Explaination of the code:
To solve the assembly code for the puzzle binary, 
I started by breaking down the disassembly into its key sections. 
I looked closely at the _init function, which sets up the program by saving important information and calling any weak functions that might be needed.

Next, I examined the Procedure Linkage Table (PLT),
which helps the program dynamically call functions from libraries, like exit and __libc_start_main.

When I got to the main function, 
I focused on how it handles input arguments and manages the flow of the program. 
I traced the calls to several utility functions (f1, f2, f3, f4), each responsible for specific tasks like processing data or performing calculations.

By understanding how these parts fit together—how they save information, load values, and check conditions—I was able to see the overall logic of the program.
This approach helped me summarize the code's behavior and how it manages tasks like input and output efficiently.
